# Matching-Model

Each set of code follows a similar structure. 
First, the model and its decision variables are defined. 
Second, the objective function is defined.
Third, the alpha matrix is generated.
Fourth, the matching constraints and the cost function constraint are added.
Finally, the model is solved, and the respective outputs such as beta coeefficients and the costs of each matching links are shown.
